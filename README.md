# This is for the project to create my own website. I share this so as to keep track of the website building.

#1 The website will be based on AWS resources (VPC, ALB, Route53, ASG, S3...)
#2 All AWS resources used for website will be deployed by Terraform to achieve full automation.

** The terraform codes will be added/updated at least once a day.
